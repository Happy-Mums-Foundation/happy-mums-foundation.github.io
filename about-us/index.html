Supporting women to be #happymums :-)
</p>

<h2 class=" editable">Who we are</h2>

<div class="row editable"><div class="col-md-3"><p>We were established in January 2015 by two local mums who had experienced maternal mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, with the aim of developing the support available to others facing similar challenges.</p><p><strong>It is our vision that no woman should experience maternal mental health problems. </strong></p><p>But we know from personal experience that our mental (and emotional) health is inseparable from our physical wellbeing. We also know that many women may not realise that what they are experiencing is, in fact, a maternal mental health issue. To address this we aim to support all women from pregnancy onwards. We use a variety of both emotional and physical approaches, signposting where appropriate if it becomes clear that mental health is a factor.</p><p>We are guided in everything that we do by our values, which ensure that our services will always be:</p><ul><li><h4>Local;</h4></li><li><h4>Practical;</h4></li><li><h4>Peer-led; and</h4></li><li><h4>In partnership</h4></li></ul><p>What we offer doesn&rsquo;t replace professional advice and treatment, but instead complements this with self-help/community-based initiatives.</p><p>A large part our work is in raising awareness, so that more women seek the help they deserve, and the stigma around mental health issues is reduced.</p></div></div>

<div class="row editable"><div class="col-md-3">&nbsp;</div><div class="col-md-9"><p>We charge a fee for some of our services (eg Daisy Birthing classes), and some of our services are free (eg support groups).&nbsp; Our constitution as a Community Interest Company ensures that any profit we make is reinvested in the Foundation. It also means that we are able to subsidise class places for women on low incomes, and offer free support to women who are either experiencing mental health problems, or are identified as being at risk from developing them.</p></div></div>
