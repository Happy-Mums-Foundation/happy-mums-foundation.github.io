		<h3>Katherine's Story</h3>
		<p>Hello!</p>

		<p>In late 2011 my beautiful daughter was born. Three weeks later I was admitted to a Mother and Baby Unit  (a specialist psychiatric hospital where mums with perinatal mental 
		health problems can go with their babies) diagnosed with postnatal depression and anxiety. Although I had suffered depression and anxiety since my late teens, it was a massive 
		shock that I became so poorly, so quickly. And it was scary for my husband and family too. After a lot of support and over time I 'recovered' - but for me, that didn't mean I 
		was the same person I had been before. I knew more about myself, and about how I wanted to help others. It was then that the idea of 'The Happy Mums Foundation' was born.
		</p>

		<p>When my daughter was 6 months old I discovered I was pregnant. I was scared that the same thing would happen again, and I became badly depressed during the pregnancy. 
		Again, with a lot of support from my family, friends, midwives and doctors I not only got through the pregnancy, but the birth and postnatal period too. Our lovely baby girl was 
		born in spring 2013. This time I didn't experience postnatal depression and I decided that it was time to put thoughts into action, and after lots of hard work and determination, 
		and with huge support from our families and friends, Gemma and I registered 'The Happy Mums Foundation' and started trading in January 2015.

		<h3>Gemma's Story</h3>
		<p>Hi Everyone</p>
 
		<p>My name is Gemma and I help to run the Happy Mums Foundation! My story is quite a common one, throughout my pregnancy I endeavoured to be as healthy as 
		possible and listened to all the advice from my midwife. I didn’t drink, lift heavy boxes, eat rare steak but I forgot about my mental wellbeing and became 
		very run down at work. I was still trying to work the hours and put in the effort I had before I was pregnant and ended up tiring myself out. 
		I left work three weeks before my due date and thought I had got through the hard part.</p>
		 
		<p>During my labour my son’s heartrate had dropped to a dangerous level and he had to be delivered by emergency caesarean section which meant that my birth 
		plan was out of the window and the first few hours of his life were spent in special care. I didn’t get to hold my little boy until he was 8 hours old and 
		I subsequently had to give up breastfeeding for medical reasons. I felt very low for the first few weeks of his life and felt that I hadn’t done a good 
		enough job bringing him into the world.</p>
		 
		<p>However shortly after I started to meet up with other mums, including Katherine, whose experiences were also not what they had planned or expected. 
		I soon started to feel better about the whole experience and realised that I wasn’t a bad mum and that lots of people had similar experiences to me. 
		Although I was never diagnosed with mental ill health having the support around me from friends and family likely helped to prevent it.</p>
		 
		<p>The Happy Mums Foundation was created to help other women who might find themselves in similar situations and enhance what’s available through the NHS. 
		Contact me at gemma@happymumsfoundation.org.uk.</p>
		 
		<p>Love Gemma x</p>
