## You Made New
 
Forget 'no pain no gain' Cocoon introduces movement for pleasure! If movement is fun and stimulates both the body and mind we feel energised, encouraged and inspired to keep moving. Cocoon creates a space that nurtures the whole person by encouraging movement that is compatible with the body's natural structure and by developing sensory awareness. With practice you can expect to cultivate a reconnection with your body and breath, to feel your energy replenished, and to discover a renewed sense of ease, balance and vitality. 
 
## Aerial Yoga

![Aerial yoga](/img/cocoonyoga-2.jpg){: .img-responsive .img-rounded }
 
In Aerial Yoga we use a soft width of fabric hung like a hammock at hip height. Using the hammock as a prop we move through a flowing sequence of classic and adapted yoga postures. With our weight supported by the fabric we explore ways of aligning and strengthening the body as well as releasing tension and decompressing joints in a way that is playful and restorative rather than stressful or strenuous. No previous yoga or flying experience necessary!
 
## Gentle Nia

![Gentle Nia](/img/cocoonyoga-3.jpg){: .img-responsive .img-rounded }

Nia is a dance movement class that blends the wisdom of the martial arts, expression of the dance arts and learning of the healing arts. It is practiced barefoot to soul-stirring music and is uplifting, stimulating, calming and fun. Nia can be danced at an intensity level that suits you and movements can be modified so that you enjoy moving at your own pace, in your own body's way. Nia provides a perfect balance of form, through learning choreography and movement technique, and freedom, by encouraging personal expression and listening to your own body's feedback. Suitable for all including perinatal mothers.
 
## Simple Yoga

Cocoon's Simple Yoga class features gentle movements, slow stretches, breath awareness and relaxation. It is designed to increase mobility, improve balance, build strength and develop somatic awareness. The class encourages improved postural alignment and nurtures a greater sense of comfort and ease by releasing muscle tension, relieving joint compression and reducing psychological stress. We will explore classic and adapted yoga postures at a slower pace allowing each individual to access a yoga practice at their own level. Suitable for anyone who wishes to practise gently and relax deeply including beginners and perinatal women.
