In 2015 we received grant funding from CN Group to purchase two inflatable birth pools for use at home.

Hiring a birth pool from The Happy Mums Foundation:

- We have two sizes available (regular and mini). The size you choose will depend on space available at home, and what we have available at that time;
- The hire period is 6 weeks, but if you need it for longer, just let us know;
- As we only have two pools we can’t guarantee there will always be one available for the requested hire period;
- We ask for a contribution of £30 per hire, as this helps us cover the cost of cleaning and maintenance. If this would prevent you from hiring a pool just let us know, we can waive fees for families on low incomes;
- The pool comes with an electric inflate/deflate pump;
- You MUST purchase and use your own liner. We can provide a discount code for use on the Birth Pools in a Box website [insert link to website] for purchasing the liner and any other accessories you might need.
