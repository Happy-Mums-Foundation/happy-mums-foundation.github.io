Mother and Baby Yoga is a great way for mother and baby to bond with each other on a physical and emotional level. Benefits include better sleep for everyone, reduction of colic and constipation and a boost to baby’s body confidence and awareness. It’s also a great way to meet other mums and their babies.

## Baby yoga

In Baby Yoga we massage, sing and stretch with baby, and work on our postpartum strength, breathing and relaxation.
 
## Mini yoga
