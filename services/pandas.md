# Please note: Our support groups are currently on hold while we recruit and train new volunteer leaders. The groups will be back in autumn 2016

&nbsp;

### Are you experiencing pre or postnatal depression?

### Or maybe you’re feeling anxious, sad, overwhelmed?

We’ve been there, and we know how hard it is. Talking to other people who understand how you feel can really help.

Our group is a safe and supportive place to meet other mums and dads in Carlisle and North Cumbria going through the same thing. Peer support can enhance any professional treatment you may be receiving, but not replace it.

Everyone is welcome.

You can come on your own, with your baby or other children, with a partner, friend or family member - whatever is best for you. There will be tea and coffee, baby changing and feeding facilities and a warm welcome. You don’t need to book, just drop in.

If you would like to make contact before coming you can call Katherine on 07565486745 or email [katherine@happymumsfoundation.org.uk](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(105,110,102,111,64,104,97,112,112,121,109,117,109,115,46,111,114,103,46,117,107))).
