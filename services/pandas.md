###Are you experiencing pre or postnatal depression?
 
###Or maybe you're feeling anxious, sad, overwhelmed?
 
Weâ€™ve been there, and we know how hard it is. Talking to other people who understand how you feel can really help.
 
Our group is a safe and supportive place to meet other mums and dads in Carlisle and North Cumbria going through the same thing. Peer support can enhance any professional treatment you may be receiving, but not replace it.  
 
We are affiliated to the national charity PANDAS (Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support). FInd out more about PANDAS on their website [www.pandasfoundation.org.uk](http://www.pandasfoundation.org.uk)
 
Everyone is welcome. 
 
Our groups are held on:  
- Mondays at Upperby CDC, Carlisle  
- Thursdays at the Coach House Centre, Carlisle
 
Take a look at our calendar to find out dates and times of the next groups. 
 
You can come on your own, with your baby or other children, with a partner, friend or family member - whatever is best for you. There will be tea and coffee, baby changing and feeding facilities and a warm welcome. You don't need to book, just drop in.
