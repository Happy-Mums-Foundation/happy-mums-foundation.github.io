I teach antenatal classes, which means I meet lots of pregnant women and I've learned that we each have our own response to the experience. You might think that by default every woman feels happy and excited during pregnancy (many do), but for others it can be a stressful and challenging time. What can we do to make it memorable for all the right reasons?
 
For some, getting pregnant has been a long journey, for others its a surprise, but any mum-to-be can experience problems like depression, anxiety or the effects of stress. 
 
While there is some evidence that the release of the hormone cortisol in these circumstances can affect the baby's development, it is important to remember that it only increases the risk of problems and most children of even very stressed mothers are fine. All the same, for both mum and baby its always best to ask for help.  
 
Having a good network of support and friendship in pregnancy is vital. In days gone by we all lived close to home, often surrounded by family and friends. Today that's not always the case; many of us move for work or relationship reasons. Maybe you're the first of your friendship group to be pregnant - if you have no-one to share the experience with it can feel lonely. So seeking out other mums-to-be at a similar stage can be a great way to make new friends for life. This might be through your antenatal classes, or 'nearly new' sales. 
 
And its not just your emotional well-being that can take a hit; although its normal to experience aches and pains, swelling, heartburn, sore ribs and constant trips to the loo - all of this can be difficult to cope with. You might also have to deal with hyperemesis (severe sickness) or pelvic girdle pain. Finding ways of keeping healthy and active (where possible) can help. Swimming is a great low-impact activity, and gentle movements that you find in a specific pregnancy yoga class can help release tension and stimulate the release of endorphins (the feel-good hormones!). 
 
A great way to reconnect with the joy of pregnancy and all that is to come, is to celebrate with a baby shower. Gather your friends and family and enjoy a day indulging yourself in thoughts of your baby. Or better still....get a friend to organise it for you! 
 
But if you feel sad, anxious or overwhelmed more often than not, its best to reach out for help. Speak to your midwife, GP or Health Visitor. There's no need to be alone, come to one of our PANDAS peer support groups to meet other women who may be experiencing similar challenges. And remember "Its Ok not to be Ok". 
 
Take care,
