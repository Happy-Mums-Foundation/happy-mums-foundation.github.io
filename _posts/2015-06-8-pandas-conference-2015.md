I was so pleased to be able to attend the PANDAS Conference in Telford on Saturday 6th June. I learned a lot about the organisation, and most importantly, met some amazing women (and men). 
 
PANDAS is a national charity supporting women with pre or postnatal illness and their families. PANDAS stands for: 

Pre  
And post  
Natal  
Depression  
Advice and  
Support  
 
Find our more on their website [www.pandasfoundation.org.uk](http://www.pandasfoundation.org.uk)
 
The support they offer takes the form of a website with information and signposting, telephone and email support, and a network of local support groups which operate indepdendently but are 'affiliated' to PANDAS, making them accessible to more and more women across the UK.

You know when you hear someone speak and you think they must have read your mind? That's what it was like for me at the conference. These women, as they spoke about their experiences and the amazing work they now do to support others going through it, were incredibly inspiring. 
 
It was out of a terrible experience of perinatal illness that PANDAS was born - the idea of Rachael Jones and Stuart Dobson, the Co-Founders. Rachael talked about being willing to go through it all again, because it was what has made her the person she is today. I can really understand how she feels. 
 
During the day we talked about the challenges of being a mum, our memories of intrusive thoughts and allowing ourselves to have 'bad days'. It was the first time I'd met so many women who had been through what I've been through, and it felt so good to be there with them.
 
Although I am very open about my history of mental health problems, there is still the fear that strangers will judge you, but this was a room where having PND was (if not quite 'normal') totally OK, in fact, life changing in a really postiive way. It reinforced, in a very personal way, just how important peer support is in recovery from maternal mental health problems. 
 
And as the PANDAS tagline says: "Its OK not to be OK".
