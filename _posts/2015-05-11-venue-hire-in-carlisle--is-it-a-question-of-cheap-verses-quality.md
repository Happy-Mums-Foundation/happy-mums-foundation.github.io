title:  "Venue hire in Carlisle - is it a question of cheap verses quality?"

At the Coach House Centre, we try to be both. It’s part of the ethos of our social enterprise that we want to support local small businesses, community groups and independent classes to succeed and grow – and if we can offer you the appropriate venue hire in Carlisle to do that, we’re a couple of very happy mums!
 
Hire of rooms is one of the main ways that we generate funding to deliver peer support projects for women with maternal mental health problems – it’s the ‘enterprise’ bit in our ‘social enterprise’. Working with us, you’re helping us to achieve our mission. Sound good? Read on!

What can our Carlisle venue hire offer you? Well, on our feedback forms the first comment is usually “great parking!” (and its true, there is lots of free parking) but it’s not just that. Our location means that we are accessible for those who live in rural areas around the city , as well as urban-dwellers too. Being so close to the A69 and M6 means we draw customers from Penrith, Brampton and Longtown, to name a few.
 
We have lovingly created three very special studios (“great atmosphere” is usually comment number two…):

- Studio One (upstairs) is a peaceful, intimate space, perfect for small classes, meetings or 1:1 therapy;
- Studio Two is home to the kitchenette for refreshments, but is also completely wheelchair accessible;
- The Potting Shed Studio is a larger room, already a favourite for events and parties.
 
They’re all bright, welcoming and flexible spaces.

We pride ourselves (as you might expect) on being family friendly: there’s an accessible toilet with baby changing facilities, toddler toilet seat, toddler step – even spare baby wipes!
 
I hope we’ve ticked the box for ‘quality’, but what about cost?
 
A regular booking, for several sessions a week can pay as little as £7.80 per hour. We think that’s competitive. And for that price there is more than just the use of the room: you will be given a key, you can store a reasonable amount of equipment, and have a page on our website. You are also sure to benefit from the cross-over of customers. Remember too that the £7.80 is reinvested in the Happy Mums Foundation.
 
So it doesn’t have to be either/or – luxury can be affordable!
Come and visit us, or just call for a chat – we’d love to find out more about what you do.
