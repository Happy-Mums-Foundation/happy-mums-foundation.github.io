In addition to the services we offer directly, we have also teamed up with other local teachers and professionals, who hire rooms at the Coach House Centre to offer:

* Mini Yoga (mum, baby and toddler yoga)
* Pregnancy and postnatal yoga
* Aerial Yoga
* Mindfulness Pilates
* Baby Massage
* Person-Centred Counselling

You can find more information about everything that goes on at the Coach House Centre under the 'Services' menu.

The income we generate from hiring our rooms means we can continue to develop the hub, and raise awareness of maternal mental health and wellbeing issues too.
